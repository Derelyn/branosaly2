Their work sparked my curiosity, and I soon found myself diving into coding during my free time. I've transformed that curiosity into expertise, completing various online courses in web development, with a strong focus on frontend and full-stack technologies. I'm constantly exploring new tools and techniques to expand my skill set and stay up to date in the ever-evolving world of development`,
